# Walmart Customer Analysis

In this project, I performed customer segmentation on Walmart's customer data using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

The dataset, walmart.csv, contains customer demographics and purchase behavior.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction before clustering. The results help in identifying distinct customer segments to improve targeted marketing strategies.
